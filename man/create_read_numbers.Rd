\usage{
create_read_numbers(mu, fit, p0, m = NULL, n = NULL, mod = NULL,
  beta = NULL, seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{mu}{Baseline mean expression for negative binomial model}

\item{fit}{Fitted relationship between log mean and log size}

\item{p0}{A vector of the probabilities a count is zero}

\item{m}{Number of genes/transcripts to simulate (not necessary if mod, beta are specified)}

\item{n}{Number of samples to simulate (not necessary if mod, beta are specified)}

\item{mod}{Model matrix you would like to simulate from without an intercept}

\item{beta}{set of coefficients for the model matrix (must have same number of columns as mod)}

\item{seed}{optional seed to set (for reproducibility)}
}
\value{
counts Data matrix with counts for genes in rows and samples in columns
}
