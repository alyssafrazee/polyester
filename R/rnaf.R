#' @title 
#'   Model of positional bias that can arise when RNA-seq is performed
#'   using protocols relying on RNA fragmentation.
#' @description 
#'   This positional bias model was estimated in Li and Jiang (2012).
#'   With RNA fragmentation, reads are more likely to have come from the middle
#'   of the transcript than either end. The probabilities included in this 
#'   dataset were estimated from Supplementary Figure S3 in Li and Jiang's 
#'   manuscript. Data points from the figure were inferred and exported as CSV 
#'   files using WebPlotDigitizer. The CSV files and the code used to process 
#'   them and create the datasets are available in the Polyester GitHub
#'   repository (\url{https://github.com/alyssafrazee/polyester}).
#' @docType data
#' @format 
#'   data frame with 100 rows and 2 columns. Column 1 is position along a
#'   transcript (in percent), while Column 2 is the probability of getting a 
#'   fragment at that position. Column 2 sums to 1.
